# Daily Reports with Node.js, Nodemailer, and Serverless Functions

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to send daily reports using Node.js, leveraging Nodemailer for email functionality and serverless functions to handle backend
processes. The reports can include various data, such as weather updates, to keep users informed about daily conditions.

## Features

-   **Daily Email Reports**: Automatically send daily email reports to specified recipients.
-   **Weather Updates**: Integrate weather data to include current conditions and forecasts in the reports.
-   **Serverless Architecture**: Utilize serverless functions for easy deployment and scalability.

## Technologies Used

-   **Node.js**: The runtime for executing JavaScript on the server.
-   **Nodemailer**: A module for sending emails easily.
-   **Serverless Functions**: To handle backend logic without managing servers.
-   **Weather API**: Integrate with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js installed on your machine.
-   An account with a cloud provider that supports serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel, or Netlify).
-   An email account for sending reports (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid).

### Installation
